Hello, I have recently graduated from technical school and have already started my studies in computer science at the Silesian University of Technology. I aspire to work as a fullstack developer or pursue an academic career in the future. Currently, I use this GitHub as a personal "journal" to track my coding progress. Most of the repositories here are projects or lessons from my technical school days, or my "sandboxes" for learning various things.

My name is Wiktor, and in 2024, I completed a five-year technical school where I earned the title of IT Technician. This is the lowest professional title, yet the only one attainable at the secondary school level in Poland. I aspire to first become a Master of Engineering in Computer Science, but I also plan, if circumstances and life permit, to pursue a PhD in mathematics or computer science.  I was born in 2004 and have been passionate about IT since childhood. Besides technology, I have a keen interest in a vast array of subjects (My autistic brain regularly latches onto a new hyperfixation), including history, economics, mathematics (particularly calculus), quantum physics, and the arts in general. As mentioned above, I use GitHub as a sort of diary where I keep all my projects and small files that I have been creating over the years. I plan to work on my portfolio in the near future. <br/>
This README.md was inspired by this guy @ForrestKnight <br/>
